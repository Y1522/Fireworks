## File Structure

```
fire works/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fireworks.html      # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fireworks.css       # Styling and responsive design
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fireworks.js        # Core application logic and physics

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Open** `fireworks.html` in a modern web browser
3. **Enjoy** the fireworks display!

No build process or server required - it runs entirely in the browser.

## Configuration Options

### Quality Settings
- **Low**: Reduced particle count, optimized for older devices
- **Normal**: Balanced performance and visual quality
- **High**: Maximum visual fidelity with enhanced effects

### Shell Sizes
- **3"** - Small, quick bursts
- **4"** - Standard size
- **6"** - Medium fireworks
- **8"** - Large displays
- **12"** - Very large shells
- **16"** - Massive finale-style bursts

### Sky Lighting
- **None**: Black background
- **Dim**: Subtle background illumination
- **Normal**: Dynamic sky coloring based on firework brightness

## Advanced Features

### Auto-Launch Sequences
When enabled, the system automatically launches various firework sequences:
- Single random shells
- Coordinated dual launches
- Triple formations
- Pyramid barrages
- Small rapid-fire sequences

### Finale Mode
Activates intense rapid-fire sequences for dramatic finale effects.

### Long Exposure Effect
Simulates camera long-exposure photography, creating extended light trails.

## Performance Tips

1. **Adjust Quality**: Lower quality settings on older devices
2. **Reduce Shell Size**: Smaller shells require less processing
3. **Disable Sky Lighting**: Improves performance on low-end devices
4. **Scale Factor**: Reduce scale for better performance
